This class I focused on providing students with a hands-on study of minerals, rocks, and topographic maps, exposing them to volcanism, hydrology, coastal processes and hazards, geologic time, and earthquakes. Both in class lectures and field trips to investigate landslides, beaches and O`ahu geology were given.
