Hello! I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at the University of Hawai'i at Manoa. I work with Dr. Shuai Li in the Hawai'i Institute of Geophysics and Planetology.

My research focuses on producing analogs of planetary surfaces and studying their visible-to-near-infrared reflectance to better interpret remote sensing observations. I mainly am interested in the Galilean moons Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto, where some of my previous work includes producing mixtures of relevant ices (water, hydrated sulfuric acid) and radiative transfer modeling of their surface characteristics; but, other airless bodies like Mercury, the Moon, and other outer planet satellites have made appearances.

I received my B.S. in Geophysics and minor in Astronomy from the University of Nevada, Reno, and my M.S. in Earth and Planetary Sciences from the University of Hawai'i at Manoa. I have loved all things planetary science my whole life, and I am excited to be in the early stages of what is hopefully a long career! Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or comments about my research! This page will serve as the hub for all my endeavors.
