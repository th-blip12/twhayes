Education
======
* Ph.D. Candidate in Earth and Planetary Sciences (Expected Graduation: Fall 2026)
* M.S. in Earth and Planetary Sciences, University of Hawai'i at Manoa, 2024
* B.S. in Geophysics, University of Nevada, Reno, 2020

Research Experience
======
* Graduate Assistant, Hawai'i Institute of Geophysics and Planetology (2022 - Current)
  * Working with Dr. Shuai Li to study surfaces of the Galilean moons and other airless bodies via VNIR reflectance spectroscopy.
  * Preparation of surface analogs (e.g. particulate mixed media of various ices, melted surfaces for specular scattering, and long-term heat treatment of samples to track changes due to thermal diffusivity)
  * Testing laboratory analogs against linear and radiative transfer modeling results. 

* Fulbright Research Fellow, Freie Universität Berlin (2022)
  * Working with Dr. Frank Postberg and colleagues to study the influence of surface topography on ejected particles in preparation for Europa Clipper's SUDA instrument.
  * Using MATLAB to model ballistic trajectories of particles in a dust exosphere around Europa through which a dummy SUDA sensor flies; main goals are to facilitate more accurate model production with actual SUDA data. 

* Post-Baccalaureate Researcher, Center for Research and Exploration in Space Sciences, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (2020 - 2021)
  * Using MATLAB to apply machine learning for automated recogniction of spectral features in Cassini's Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS).

* Planetary Science Intern, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (2020)
  * Using MATLAB for development of an ingestion, display, and quick clustering analysis for Cassini CIRS data.
  * Application of 2019 research to the much noisier CIRS dataset.
 
* Green Geophysics Technician (2020) 
   * Part of the team responsible for the installation and extraction of magnetotelluric and transient magnetic surveys in Nevada for University of Oregon’s EarthScope electromagnetic array.
  
* Planetary Science Intern, NASA Langley Research Center (2019)
  * Working with Cindy Young to develop a proof-of-concept machine learning algorithm for spectral feature identification fo Cassini's Visible and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS)
  * Classified spectral features into groups based on band-depth and shape.
 
* Center for Neotectonic Studies Intern, University of Nevada, Reno (2018)
  * Developer and organizer of new western US aerial photogrammetry database.
