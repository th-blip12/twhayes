Education
======
* Ph.D. Candidate in Earth and Planetary Sciences (Expected Graduation: Fall 2026)
* M.S. in Earth and Planetary Sciences, University of Hawai'i at Manoa, 2024
* B.S. in Geophysics, University of Nevada, Reno, 2020

Research Experience
======
* Graduate Assistant, Hawai'i Institute of Geophysics and Planetology (2022 - Current)
  * Working with Dr. Shuai Li to study surfaces of the Galilean moons and other airless bodies via VNIR reflectance spectroscopy.
  * Preparation of surface analogs (e.g. particulate mixed media of various ices, melted surfaces for specular scattering, and long-term heat treatment of samples to track changes due to thermal diffusivity)
  * Testing laboratory analogs against linear and radiative transfer modeling results. 

* Fulbright Research Fellow, Freie Universität Berlin (2022)
  * Working with Dr. Frank Postberg and colleagues to study the influence of surface topography on ejected particles in preparation for Europa Clipper's SUDA instrument.
  * Using MATLAB to model ballistic trajectories of particles in a dust exosphere around Europa through which a dummy SUDA sensor flies; main goals are to facilitate more accurate model production with actual SUDA data. 

* Summer 2015: Research Assistant
  * GitHub University
  * Duties included: Tagging issues
  * Supervisor: Professor Git
